This article looks at the problem in reverse, by showing you how to make HTTP requests from your Node.js applications. You may be asking yourself why you would want to do that. Two applications come to mind right away web scraping and proxying . Scrapers are pieces of software which download web pages and programatically extract information from them. Proxy servers act as intermediaries, forwarding client requests to other servers and returning the responses.'
